## Introduction

Smith IS Datathon is a business challenge in which teams of up to 4 students', proctored by Smith IS members, compete against each other to solve a set of programming problems in two weeks long time span.

## Problem Statement
Image Classification
* A picture is worth a thousand words, yet sometimes a few will do. We all rely on online images for knowledge sharing, learning, and understanding. The majority of images on Hearst Database come from various categories and do not have any written context connected to the image. In this competition, we will build a model that automatically retrieves the text closest to an image. Specifically, we will train a model to associate given images with tags.

## Data Processing and Modeling
EDA + Data Pre-Processing + Modeling
